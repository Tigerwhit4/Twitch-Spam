# Twitch-Spam
This repository serves as the backend of [Twitch Spam](//rtainc.co/twitch-spam), a project that gives various ways to combat spam on Twitch.

This is hosted on GitHub as to provide the fastest-updating tools as possible. If you see a new spam link or bot username, **please submit a [Pull Request](//github.com/rtainc/Twitch-Spam/pulls)**. If you are unable to do so, submitting an [issue](//github.com/rtainc/Twitch-Spam/issues) is the next best way to contribute.

## Plans
I have no plans for the project at the moment, so I have wrapped all files in the `dev` folder as to not break compatibility with restructuring. If you want a reliable, polished source, please use the [official project](//rtainc.co/twitch-spam).
