# Twitch-Malware
This project will house tools to combat malware spam, including (but not limited to) spam link lists, spam username lists, and automatic banning scripts.

Feel free to use this code in anyway - there is no license. The first implementation will be in [Nerdbot v4.1](https://nerdbot.tv).
